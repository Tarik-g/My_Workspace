This is my personal workspace.
Here I learned everything about python, data structures and algorithms.
I also learned the basics of numpy and pandas.
Further I made some complex drawings with algorithms in Python turtle.
I did some small projects like a pdfmerger and a custom command to search google or open chatgpt via the cmd and git bash.

There are also some projects I started but have'nt finished yet.
